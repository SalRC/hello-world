Epic1Feature2 file

release 1 attributes: C,D,E

Emergency modifications to this file required as a part of hotfix - a new branch will be created which would be later on merged back to main once changes are tested

New additions to this file under Rel6 Branch on 02/02/2018 (This line modified for Rel07 - date format changed 02/02/2018)

Another change to the file in Master Branch to check conflict while merging the updated Branch from Rel6 - added on 02-02-2018

Retaining both the lines - one added from Rel6 & one added directly into Main - just delete the ">>>> Rel6" and ">>>>Main" headers which highlight the changes


Added new line in Rel07 - this file will be committed to Rel07 through a Pull Request 
(by creating another branch first - the changes will be reviewed within that new Branch and merged to Rel07 branch post that)

Added new line in Rel6 branch (this file has also been modified in Rel7 branch)
This would be merged with Main before Rel7 branch is merged

Retaining changes from both Rel6 & Rel7 lines 14, 15 and 17,18 respectively in the file
